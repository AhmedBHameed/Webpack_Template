## ðŸ”¬ Installation

Make a project clone into your machine using Git CLI
```JS
git clone https://github.com/AhmedBHameed/Webpack_Template.git
```
Then install the package using node package manager
```JS
npm install
```
Your main application is app.ts so import any modules,classes,sass,css files inside it.
Modify your index.ejs which is the main template. Any extra library try to attach them inside your app.ts then the package will bundle and attach them all as a final product.
It is located under src folder.
dist is the final project after compiling.

* For testing the project using localhost:9000 server use
```JS
npm run serve
```

* For building the project using as final product use
```JS
npm run build
```

Note: running any task will make the project in watch mode which that means any changes will be directly detected. 
Enjoy...
